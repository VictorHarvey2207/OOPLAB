- The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are called. What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch?
If the Aims class is not updated to handle exceptions that may be generated by the play() methods, any attempt to use the Aims class will result in a compilation error. Specifically, the error message will state: "The method play() from the type Playable refers to the missing type PlayerException." This occurs because the play() method is defined to throw a PlayerException, and without proper handling or acknowledgment of the exception in the Aims class, the Java compiler will flag this as an issue, preventing the program from compiling successfully.
